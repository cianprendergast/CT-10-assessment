Wireframe Feedback Evaluation

I wasnâ€™t able to collect too much feedback due to being behind for the latter half of the project, but of the feedback there is;
Usability:

Overall, nothing negative about how clear navigation is or how easy and quick it is to navigate.

Aesthetics:
The comments on the aesthetics were good for the most part, however there was a comment or two about the character info text being bigger to take up more of the empty space.

Functionality:
Some of the people who answered have said that the wireframes may be slightly difficult to implement in a timely manner while following tutorials, but apart from that, the wireframes easily met the projects purpose and requirements.

From this feedback, I have learnt that my UX design skills are pretty good, however I should look to perfect them and get them just right, while also making the designs plausible to implement within the game without too much trouble.

The feedback about the plausibility of design definitely changed my perspective on the UX design that I have done in these wireframes and that I will do during the project. I will probably make my designs more simple so that they are easier to implement within the game so I can do them more quickly and therefore complete more aspects of the project.
