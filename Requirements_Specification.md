Requirement Specification

Purpose:
The game will allow people to play through a story that is similar to that of the book. The story will not be completely similar to that of the book to make it more engaging as a game.
The game is designed to engage fans within the genre and also be engaging to people who aren't fans of the book or genre and possibly lead them toward reading the book or others in the genre.

Use Cases:
1; Users will choose one of the characters to play as which will influence certain events in the game. They will select to play a new game and then they will be able to choose between characters and play as those characters throughout the game.
2; Users will be able to interact with non player characters in the game.
3; Users will be able to use the a and d keys to move left and right as well as w or spacebar for jumping.
4; Users will be able to interact with certain objects/characters with the e key

Test Cases (Planned):
When the user selects start, the game will start
When the user selects settings the settings configuration will open
I will test how well the features work in unity and can get a few others to peer test it as well to make sure that they work on different OS, etc.
I will make sure that people with; a good computer, a bad computer, macOS, and a windows laptop can run the game. 


Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:
All loading times will be kept below two seconds. This can vary from computer to computer, but I will keep a benchmark of a computer that doesn't have the best parts.

Usability: 
There will be a consistent layout of the ui throughout sections; Active gameplay will always look the same, settings will look the same in different areas of settings, etc. The font size and type will be selected to be easy to read and understand so that people who have challenges reading or understanding will be able to play the game as normal. The layouts for the ux will be designed similar to norms of many games so that the layouts will be intuitive and easy to understand.

Reliability:
I will test the game on different devices with different screen sizes and parts so as to assure the reliability of the experience across different hardware.

Security:
The game doesn't need any privacy considerations as it is a single player game and stores all data locally.
