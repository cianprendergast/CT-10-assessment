Project Proposal

Design Brief:

    The book I have chosen is Salvage by Keren David and I am going to be making a platformer game that follows the themes of the book. The target audience is designed to be people who have played platformer games before and would like to play a fun game.

Book Choice and Justification:

    The book I have chosen is called Salvage and is by Keren David. The book is about two siblings who were separated when they were young due to inadequate care from their caretaker and have completely opposite experiences growing up. One day however, they manage to find each other and meet. I chose this book because it seemed like an interesting concept to me and the writing was good as well. 

User Experience Type:

    For this assignment, I will make use of unity to create a 2d platformer game. 
    This 2d platformer game will enhance the themes of the book by allowing people to play through a similar story and have their own experience with it, which will give them a deeper connection to the story.

Target Market

    The target audience for this game is anyone that would like to play a platformer game. It probably won’t be for anyone under the age of 12 or 13 due to the theme the game is about, however, that’s the only real limitation for recommended audience. It is mainly targeted to people who have played games before though. It will appeal to them as it will be a fun platformer that is based on the themes from the book which they presumably will have read before playing it. I will make at least a few of the ux design choices based off of videogame cliches in the genre. This will make it more easily accessible by people who have already played platformers before.

Software and Tools

	I am planning on using Adobe XD, Unity and Piskel to create my project. 
	Adobe XD is suitable for the project due to being an easy to use software that I can use to create the ux design for the game menus and gameplay.
	Unity is suitable for the project because it is a software I am familiar with that will allow me to create my game efficiently and well as it is the industry standard Software
