Final Evaluation:

My project did not reach the purpose specification very effectively, as it doesn't have an interactive story and therefore isn't closely based off the book which means that it doesnt meet the purpose specification.

My project met one of the four use cases. It allowed you to use WASD, the arrow keys and spacebar to manouvre around the map, but didnt let you interact with npc's or items with 'e', nor can you choose a character to play, though I almost got to getting character selection, however I just couldn't get it to work properly.

I didn't really meet the test cases specification either, as I could run the game and get from the title screen to gameplay, but apart from that, there wasn't much else that I could test. I was severely limited by the fact that I was behind for the latter half of the project, and due to this was unable to meet the criteria.

The games performance held up extremely well, as I barely had stutters, and the loading times were a second at most.

There wasn't too much of the usability specification present, but in the places where it could be the project was consistent, so it did ok at the usability specifications.

I was unable to test the reliability of the game on other devices due to being under time constraints and therefore not having enough time to get the final product to other people, so I did badly on the reliability specification.

The game doesn't have anywhere it stores your data, and isn't even online so there is no security risk for it.

I think that the game somewhat reaches what was specified in the project proposal, in that the target audience and software/tools have stayed the same, however it could be much more appealing if the project had gotten further into development, however because I was behind on time for various reasons I was unable to get as much done as would've made the criteria that I set in the project proposal.

My project adresses the legalities and ethics of game development by using multiple free to use, even commercially, services/assets, including the base for the game and the background for the title screen. It adresses the necessary social responsibilities by not being to close to the book in any way.

I felt that I mismanaged some of my time during early term one, on top of being away semi often over term one and this term, which led to many decisions to decrease the quality of the project to get it done on time. I do however feel that I could've used my resources at home, like my computer, to continue doing work, even while I was away, and that would've increased my progress exponentially. I wasn't meeting milestones, even at the end of term one, as I was already behind due to absence, which only set me further back. I did however try to overcome being far behind by doing lots of work at home over week 4. Overall I think I mismanaged my time at the start of the unit, however as we got later in, I was able to manage my time correctly and adapt to the challenge of being behind and still get a product in to be marked. I also didn't try as much as I should've to keep consistent progress at home.

I didn't gather feedback that well as I was only able to gather the feedback from a small group of people, due to time constraints. because of this, i was unable to effectively gather, understand and implement much feedback.
