Social, Ethical and Legal Issues

Social Impact:

Target Audience Considerations;
There really isn't a target audience for this game, apart from being slightly drawn towards people who already play videogames.

Potential Benefits;
This game could draw more attention to the book its based off, as well as draw attention to people who have gone through a story similar to that of the book or the game and need help.

Potential Risks;
The story will be changed to make the game more engaging, however, this could make some people upset, as they may like the original story better.

Ethical Responsibilities:

User Data and Privacy;
The prototype will collect user data, in the form of savestates of the game, however these wil be stored locally and will be in a safe location and only accessed when loading the game.

Representation and inclusion;
The project will try to fairly represent the characters and themes from the book, however, there is no guaruntee that the characters are represented completely to how the original author would want, as it is a different setting with the same overarching idea.

Content Sensitivity;
The book contains a somewhat controversial topic, which is children being seperated from their birth parents. The prototype will make sure to handle these topics as sensetively as possible while keeping the story as close as possible.

Legal Considerations:

Copyright and Intellectual Property;
I will create original assets and I will try to use the characters from the book, however, if I am unable to use them due to copyright, then the characters will also be changed to be original. However the general theme of the game will be the same as the book.

Terms of Use
There may be some copyght of characters if I were to release the game, however apart from that, there really isn't much other copyright consideration.
