Producing and Implementing

Sprint 1:
	Prototype:
I used a unity 2d microgame tutorial and built off of it by adding in my own working title screen, with play and exit buttons that work, and a setting button that does nothing for now. The gameplay aspects are all the same as the microgame that comes with the tutorial except for the physics options, as I have set them to be what I believe are the ‘optimal values’

Test:
I tested the game as well as one other person, and we tested out my changes to the physics and looked at the title screen and made sure they worked.

Evaluate:
The title screen is something that we both agreed needed to be approved upon, as it looked very bad. The title screen was very easy to understand and simple to navigate, which means that it is a well designed title screen. The prototype worked fine and didn’t have any issues with responsiveness or latency, which was partly due to the fact that it was built off of a tutorial, however it still makes it a good base game, with good performance. Me and the person I surveyed thought that the title screen needed to be spiced up and that the game itself could use a little more uniqueness. Next sprint I will definitely improve the looks of the title screen as they are subpar at best and don’t fit the quality of the game that I want, and if I get to it I may add a character or two.

Sprint 2:
	Prototype:
I produced the prototype for sprint 2, where I completely finished the title screen and started to add in my own character so that I can add the option to switch between them. The progression that I am making limits me to an unfinished game in the time available, however if I can get a working prototype with character selection, then I will be satisfied with my work.

Feedback:
Everyone who I got feedback from said that they thought the title screen was good, but once you got into the gameplay, the character didn’t really fit with everything, because it was a fully animated stick figure character, after being on a title screen full of pixel art. This prototype was more user friendly than the previous one, because the previous one had a monochrome title screen, which would’ve made it difficult for someone with a visual impairment to tell which button does what, but now they are colour coded, green for start and red for exit, which will allow it to be much more easily accessible to people with visual impairment. The performance was mostly the same as the last build, however I did notice the occasional stutter while testing. Some people said that the stick figure character did not fit with the title screen, while others said that they didn’t think it mattered, but I think, considering there is even some concern for that part of the game, a character select screen is the next feature in order for the game.

Sprint 3:
	Prototype:
	I couldn’t get a prototype to work with the character select, so there is no third sprint.
